      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> I started out making wallpapers a little over a year ago as a bit of a hobby, taking pictures of random things 
      that I thought looked cool and editing them using the editing feature in Google Photos. As I progressed in experience, 
      I started finding my groove, and found the things that I look for, usually interesting colors or textures. I found that 
      even the most ordinary looking things can turn extremely cool looking with extra saturation or a little push on the shadows
      of the image.  
      </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>CJ's Wallpapes makes high-quality wallpaper images that will adorn all those who want just a little more from their 
      lock or home screen. Whether you are an Android user who is tired of of the boring selection that Gooogle has to offer, 
      or an Apple user wanting a bit more customization for their wallpapers, we take everyone that uses a mobile phone. These
      Wallpapes can even be used as touch keyboard wallpapers.

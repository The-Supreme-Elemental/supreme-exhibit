## This is a Weather App in Flask via Python. 

This app will allow a user to input a city and receive the weather from that city for that day. I aim to have this project reference a live database, probably from a weather website, and display it to 
the user. At this current moment, the program is only able to display the weather for the current moment, but I plan on making it so that multiple forecasts can be displayed.

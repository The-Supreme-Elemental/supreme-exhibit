# supreme-exhibit

This is my porfolio of personal projects. These can include academic projects that I have decided to build more upon, or 
projects that I feel really show off my capabilities. 

Below I have listen the projects that appear on this repository

#### - CJ's Wallpapes. 
    - This is a mobile wallpaper/stock photo business aimed at people who want their stock photos or phone wallpapers to be more natural. This photos focus on mostly macrophotography, with close up shots of random stuff I think looks
    cool. This website is still very bare bones, but soon it will have more features.

#### - 

The current projects on this site include PoGo Info, and CJs Wallpapes. Both sites can run, but will be updated soon. 

PoGo Info v1 is an informational website that goes over the basic information about the hit mobile game Pokemon Go, and lists
everything a casual player would need to know. v2 of the site will add details more attuned to more committed players. v2 will
also attempt to adapt several current website trends; however, such trends have not been decided on yet. For your convenience, 
the site can be visited at https://the-supreme-elemental.github.io/supreme-exhibit/pogoinfo/index.html.

CJs wallpapes is a wallpaper/stock photo business aimed at people who want their stock photos to be different. As of now, the 
website is not very dynamic, with the only thing being a janky slideshow. This will be replaced for a smoother looking gallery, 
with lazy loaded images and resized images. 

These are the only projects as of now I feel comfortable sharing with the outside world, but more projects will soon follow suit 
and show their faces here.

# supreme-exhibit

This is my porfolio of personal projects. These can include academic projects that I have decided to build more upon, or 
projects that I feel really show off my capabilities. 

Below I have listed the projects that appear on this repository.

#### 1. [CJ's Wallpapes](https://the-supreme-elemental.github.io/supreme-exhibit/cjswallpapes/wallpapers.html). 
    - This is a mobile wallpaper/stock photo business aimed at people who want their 
    stock photos or phone wallpapers to be more natural. This photos focus on mostly 
    macrophotography, with close up shots of random stuff I think looks cool. This 
    website is still very bare bones, but soon it will have more features. This website
    is hosted on Github Pages. (Note, CJ's Wallpapes is the name of the business. 
    It is not a typo.)

#### 2. [PoGo Info](https://the-supreme-elemental.github.io/supreme-exhibit/pogoinfo/index.html)
    - PoGo Info is an informational and educational website that goes over the basic 
    information about the hit mobile game Pokemon Go. This website lists everything that
    a casual player of the game would need to know, with the exception of Dynamax Raids, 
    a key staple from within the last year or so. The website will also be updated with a 
    hardcore player's guide, featuring more in-depth information on all aspects of the game, 
    including a brand new section on PVP! 
    (Disclaimer. This website is a fan project, and is not affiliated or endorsed by Niantic, 
    Scopely, or The Pokemon Company. Pokemon GO, Pokemon, and all related assets are trademarks 
    of The Pokemon Company, Niantic, and their respective owners. )

#### 3. [Flask Weather App](https://github.com/The-Supreme-Elemental/supreme-exhibit/tree/main/Flask%20Weather%20App) 

    - This is a basic project that is written in the Python web framework of Flask. It fetches 
    data from an outside API and displays it to the user within a clean display screen. 
    
    - My goals for this project were to learn a new framework and learn about APIs.

#### 4. [Data Learning Projects](https://github.com/The-Supreme-Elemental/supreme-exhibit/tree/main/python-data-learning)

    - These projects were a part of a course I am taking on AI development with Python, 
    featuring the libraries of NumPy, Pandas, and MatplotLib.
    
    - I am still learning these libraries, but these are here to show that I am learning 
    about how to filter, analyze, and visualize data.  

    NOTE: The programs in this folder will not run unless pandas, numpy, seaborn, 
    scikit-learn, and matplotlib are installed. You can install them by going to your terminal 
    and inputting the command "pip install pandas" or "pip install numpy" and so on.
